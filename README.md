# Project - Electrical Machine 

This is an academic project within TUCN, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, 
which involves the electromagnetic calculation of an asynchronous electric machine.  

The calculations are performed in MATLAB, and in the future, I plan to introduce the digital implementation of the necessary graphs for acquiring the initial data.
